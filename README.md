# Chart Visualization Assignment

The chart should have these features:

* [ ] Animation that steps through the data, displaying each year for 2 seconds
      before proceeding to the next year.

* [ ] A progress bar that shows the currently displayed year's relationship to
      the other years in the dataset.

* [ ] A play/pause button which enables and disables the animation, pausing on
      whichever year is currently being shown

* [ ] Year and play/paused state are persisted as query parameters in the URL.
      For example, `http://localhost:3000/?paused=true&year=2002` should load
      the page with the animation already paused and the year set to 2002

Don't hesitate to ask questions. You are allowed (expected?) to take
implementation shortcuts for time. After all, this is how real software projects
go. Simply document them, so we can discuss them with you!
